###Guildlist notes###

Asterixes indicate that a guild has been added to the list of feeding guilds in the North Sea (Greenstreet et al., 1997).

- \* indicates a guild represented in the unedited guild list, but with a synomymous species name. These could easily be added to the synonymous guild

- \*\* indicates a guild _not_ represented in the unedited guild list, and has been added manually, using data from Fishbase.org

- 

### Graphs ###

-- Percentages for effort data is calculated in seperate datasets rather than upon load, as it is probably much easier to automate late on, should that become relevant.

- ddply is used to calculate percentages

### Automation ###

-- Gear renaming; Gears needs to be grouped by actual gears, without restriction tags ("R-*"), but without overwriting to original data

-- Catches needs to be summed by **year**, and grouped with **gears** and **species**, in their respective **ecoregions**, and **sub-regions**. A solution may be to have R read column names, and act based on that.

### General notes for data ##

-- Column names can't start with numbers. Remember this; it will cause you trouble later, if you do not adhere by the Data Governing laws of the Almighty R.        
The Almigthy R (praised be its name) is able to interpret raw text-data, without messing it up - just be careful what you write in your `read.delim() `.

-- Fleet **capacity** is reported only for some countries, and in Gross Tonnage (GT), as opposed to kilowatts (kW). **Effort** is reported in kilowattdays (kWd).
